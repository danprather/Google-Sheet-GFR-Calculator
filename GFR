Create a new sheet and add labels in A1..I1
Columns "TEST DATE"	"AGE"	"CREATININE"	"GFR"	"Age (for Calc)"	"BIRTHDAY"	"SEX (M or F)"	"K"	"α"
Add Birthday in F2 and Sex in G2
Add test date in A2 and Creatinine value in C2
All other Fields are calculated.
Add the formulas to each column for the rows needed
Test Date format yyyy-mm-dd
Age Formula =DATEDIF($F$2,A3,"Y")&"+"&DATEDIF($F$2,A3,"YM")&" Mo."
Creatinine value in mg/dL
GFR Formula =142 * POWER(min(C2/$H$2, 1),$I$2) * POWER(max(C2/$H$2, 1),-1.2) * POWER(0.9938,E2)
Age (for calc) formula =(DATEDIF($F$2,A2,"Y"))
Birthday format mm/dd/yyyy
Sex M or F 
K formula =IF(Upper($G$2)="M",0.9,0.7)
α formula =IF(Upper($G$2)="M",-0.302,-0.241)

Notes
You can add as many rows as you like. Rows G2..I2 do not need repeated. They are constants.
AGE column B is calculated in years and months to better represent multple test in a single year. 
AGE column E is calculated in years only as required by the formula.
The GFR formula is from https://www.kidney.org/content/ckd-epi-creatinine-equation-2021
